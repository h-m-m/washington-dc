### What is Papers We Love?

Papers We Love (PWL) is a community built around reading, discussing and learning more about academic computer science papers.

What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and loved? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper. Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss.

You can find previous PwL presentations on [YouTube][youtube].

### Who are we?

We are developers, engineers, academics, and other tech professionals who live in the DC metro area. Whether you're a new computer science student or a seasoned Java developer, we welcome you to join us–the only requirements are respect and an eagerness to learn!
